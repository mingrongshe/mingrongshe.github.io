  - title: Gender differences in collaboration and career progression in physics
    authors: Mingrong She, Jan Bachmann, Fariba Karimi, Leto Peel
    project: We examine gender differences in collaboration behaviour and academic career progression in physics. We use coauthorship ego networks to capture collaborative behaviour and use the likelihood and time to become a principal investigator (PI) and the length of an author's career to measure career progression.
