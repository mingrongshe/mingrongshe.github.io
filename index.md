<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">About Me</h2>

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at [Maastricht university](https://www.spin-ion.com/), working under the mentorship of Dr. [Leto Peel](https://piratepeel.github.io/) and [Fariba Karimi](https://www.csh.ac.at/researcher/fariba-karimi/). My research lays in applying statistical inference and network analysis to large-scale gender-annotated bibliometric datasets to investigate gender mixing and its impact on dropout, which could develop agent-based models of enrollment, promotion, and dropout in academia and use these to investigate mitigation strategies.

## Research Interest:
- **Network Inequality:** ego network, gender differences
- **Local Assortativity:**
